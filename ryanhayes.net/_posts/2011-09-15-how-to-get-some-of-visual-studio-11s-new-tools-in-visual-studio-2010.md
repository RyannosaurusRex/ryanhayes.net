So much has come out this week at [//Build/](https://www.buildwindows.com) that it's hard to keep track of everything. For developers, the big thing is the first preview of Visual Studio 11 and the new SDKs and tools that go along with it. As you download the tools from dev.windows.com or your MSDN subscription, you may or may not have noticed that some of the new features come straight out of the [Productivity Power Tools that are available TODAY from the Visual Studio Plugin Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/d0d33361-18e2-46c0-8ff2-4adea1e34fef).  So, if you're trying out the new Windows 8 dev build and like what you see, you may want to also check out the power tools.  It's no ReSharper, but it does have some cool features that'll help you navigate your solutions!

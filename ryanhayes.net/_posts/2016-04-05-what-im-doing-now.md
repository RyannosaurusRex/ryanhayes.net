This year I've decided to focus on a few things to become a better developer, and do things that make more of a difference in my life, my family's life, others' lives, and my career, but with less work. There is no shortage of project ideas that I could explore, places to visit, meetups to attend, or emails to reply to, and that's kind of the problem.  Recently, I ran across someone who had a /now page on their website.  It's a movement started by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/).  It's similar to an /about page, but answers the question "What are you focusing on right now?".  It's the elevator pitch to what you would tell a friend that you hadn't talked to in a year, which is really great to know, but that's now _why_ it's great. It's great because it forces you to put down into writing your priorities. It forces you to look at the short list of the things that matter to you, and it gives you really, **really** fast feedback if you're "focusing" on way too many different things.  So, from now on, I'm going to keep a section of my site up to date on the [/now](https://ryanhayes.net/now/ "Now") page.

I'm always interested in ways to help automate my "0-60" introduction and help people better understand where I'm at, so that we can both help each other out better.  **How do you keep acquaintances and random internet passer-bys up to date on where you currently are in life? Is there something better?**

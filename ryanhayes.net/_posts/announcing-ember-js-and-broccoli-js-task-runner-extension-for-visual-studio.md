Visual Studio has an amazing task runner that lets you integrate run task-based command line tools into VS's build system.  This means you can list commands and even set them to run with builds right inside Visual Studio without even touching the command line!  This is great for getting your team using these command line tools, while taking baby steps if your team isn't comfortable with the command line yet.  The Broccoli Task Runner adds support for both Broccoli files as well as EmberCLI files, which means all your Ember.JS apps now have full support in Visual Studio!

You can [download the tools in the Visual Studio Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dd19e6af-a1f7-4606-a82a-46833f810865) or [contribute to it (since it's open source) on Github](https://github.com/RyannosaurusRex/BroccoliTaskRunner).

 Because you didn’t buy them OnDemand in the cloud and they’re disk-based games that you can sell to a friend, or keep forever in disk form (and keep a working PS3 in order to play).  <strong>Since disk based games are without DRM, Sony can’t guarantee that you and your friends didn’t all use the same disk to tell them you “bought” it.</strong>  So, while you’re free to do what you want with your disks, when your hardware or disk dies, so does the game (to Ebay!).</p>\n<p><strong>Gaikai is the future of gaming, and PS4 announced it first.  **The issue is, in order to get all of the convenience of the cloud, to be able to have the game on any console, and, more importantly, **to be able to even play the disk game I bought in the cloud from my PS3 OR PS4, there must be some form of DRM.  **For disk games, the DRM is the fact that there’s only one disk, and either I, or my friend, can have that one disk in our possession at any one time.  **On Xbox One, all disk games are actually cloud games, and are all installed, and all in the cloud upon purchase.</strong>  Does Xbox One have a service like Gaikai?  No, but Azure is an incredible and reliable service platform, and puts Microsoft in a stronger position in the cloud.  Five years from now, when devs are hitting the edge of what the PS4 and Xbox One can push, Azure will be there to essentially infinitely extend the computation power of the Xbox one. ** Another 5 years after that and we’ll be in an era where Gaikai-like services are the norm, and at that point, the DRM that Xbox pushed on us will be the only way they can determine that I, Ryan, bought Forza 5 and still own Forza 5 (or determine that I traded it to a friend, or in for a new game).**  Since we lived from E3 on with no more disk-based games, when Xbox One goes ALL streaming, all of my past library will be there.  That’s something we’ve never had before.  <strong>Never again will I have to re-buy Final Fantasy XII, or re-buy whatever game I want to keep forever, because they re-release the exact same game as an On-Demand title on ever new system.</strong></p>\n<p>So, is DRM different?

due to my WordPress blog’s plugins that help users discover other content on the site.  I’ve got about four different places on my WordPress blog that help guide users into related content on my site that just weren’t there in Ghost. That’s not really Ghost’s fault, as it does the actual content authoring extremely well, however it doesn’t change the fact **a big reason you write content on a blog

plugins or hand-code all of these other features that you may need, but then we get back to the part where you’re at a huge disadvantage if you aren’t a developer.</p>\n<h2>Back to WordPress</h2>\n<p>I ended up moving back to WordPress because keeping my page views are more important to me than being able to edit and preview on the same screen.  Luckily I had a backup that I could flip back to, but I still had the problem of HostGator being pretty slow and taking my site down whenever a post would get featured on a big website somewhere (I had <a href=\"https://ryanhayes.net/how-the-xbox-one-lost-me-and-then-won-me-back-with-the-cloud/\" title=\"How the Xbox One lost me, and then won me back with 24-Hour DRM and the cloud.\">one post</a> get really high on Reddit one day and my site was down for most of the day, sadly).</p>\n<p>Here’s what I did differently this time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moved hosting (as well as the majority of my clients) over to WPEngine</li>\n<li>\n<p>Just bit the bullet and did a <a href=\"https://www.webpagetest.org/\" title=\"Web page speed audit\">page speed audit</a> on my site to speed things up </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pnggauntlet.com/\">Optimized all my site images</a></li>\n<li>Deactivated and removed unused plugins</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Leveraged a CDN (content delivery network) using WPEngine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these changes, I actually got my site loading VERY quickly, which was part of the original goal anyway.  In addition, I got all my discovery features back to get my pageviews back up, which I didn’t want to lose with the work I had done over the years.</p>\n<h2>Ghost vs WordPress: The Takeaway</h2>\n<p>I love Ghost, and I’ll likely be spending some free time contributing plugins (called “apps”) in order to get Ghost up to speed so I can move.  The Ghost team is awesome and for WordPress having a 10 year head start on Ghost, it’s come surprisingly far in such a short amount of time.  However, <strong>the 10 extra years of plugins and features that WordPress has are hard to beat.</strong>  If you’re trying to decide between the two:</p>\n<h3>Use Ghost If:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Your blog is just starting out (301 redirects for a lot of history require setting them up the old fashioned way)</li>\n<li>You care more about getting your ideas down than having people read everything you’ve written</li>\n<li>Are a hacker/dev and want a site that runs on Node.JS (this was a big reason I loved Ghost)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Use WordPress if:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You want something hackable, but not something you need to potentially need to babysit</li>\n<li>Need more features than just blogging</li>\n<li>Have very minimal dev experience and don’t want to <em>have to</em> invest in learning the platform</li>\n<li>The command line scares you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your mileage may vary, of course.  Keep in mind I am a developer and was looking to self-host, or at least have 100% full access to the guts of my install.  <strong>Both of these platforms work great for pure blogging and you can hire someone to host/manage them if you’re not a developer, however WordPress clearly wins if you’re looking pure features as opposed to the raw speed and simplicity of Ghost.</strong></p>\n<p>Have <strong>you</strong> tried both?  Which one did you land on?  **What is the one critical plugin you absolutely have to have in Ghost before you would make the move? ** Let me know in the comments

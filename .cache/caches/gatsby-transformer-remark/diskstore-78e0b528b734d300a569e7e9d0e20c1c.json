that I get free Azure time. &#xA0;Awesome! &#xA0;I built my application for my startup, went to deploy to Azure and then realized that I only had ONE database I could use for free. &#xA0;Oh noes (I&apos;m<del> a cheapskate</del>&#xA0;frugal)! &#xA0; I immediately tried to find a way around this. &#xA0;I had my ASP.NET membership database and my application database separate (it&apos;s kind of a hassle editing the .mdf&#x2026;too slow for multiple, rapid deployments for me). &#xA0;So then I read where you can<a href=\"https://weblogs.asp.net/sukumarraju/archive/2009/10/02/installing-asp-net-membership-services-database-in-sql-server-expreess.aspx\"> generate the membership database anywhere I want</a>, where it didn&apos;t have to be in the .mdf that was provided. &#xA0;I immediately thought to generate it alongside the other tables in my application DB. When I tried generating it, as I was developing the application and using the regular entity framework to generate my application tables in the same database, the provider and DB would become out of sync and start throwing errors occasionally. &#xA0;It was extremely frustrating. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t happen all the time, but enough to make me lose time. &#xA0;I knew it would WORK, but the hassle of dealing with it wasn&apos;t worth it to save me from having to purchase an extra database instance to keep them separate. &#xA0;This is where CodeFirst Membership came it. &#xA0;It&apos;s an implementation of a membership provider (same security and everything), but uses a DbContext and CodeFirst! &#xA0;What does this mean? &#xA0;This means I can use EntityFramework CodeFirst for my application code, and just use the same DbContext for the provider and my

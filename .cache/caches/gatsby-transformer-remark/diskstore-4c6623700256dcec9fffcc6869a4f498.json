It&apos;s all seamless at the user level.\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>XNA being separate from the Metro UI shouldn’t shock you (you’ve seen it before!).</strong> Have you ever used a Windows Phone?  The UI is all written in Silverlight and has a Metro UI that Windows 8 uses as inspiration.  In Windows Phone, you have the Metro UI for most everything and any games you see are written in XNA.  This is essentially what Microsoft has shown with Windows 8.  The Metro UI is the new interface for <strong>touch apps</strong>, not Photoshop or Visual Studio or any other application that requires a lot of tools and a lot of text entry.  Touch isn’t for everything – any good UX person (including those at Microsoft) knows this.  Even if there were no such thing as the Windows Seven-esque chrome UI anymore, I would still expect XNA to be separate and run separately.  At the end of the day the separation isn’t seen or cared about by the user.  They’ll go to the Metro UI home screen and slide through tiles; they’ll click on your game icon; your game will run and they’ll be happy.  The seamlessness is still there and the user doesn’t care if XNA is “inside” a Metro app or not.  They just have fun – how things should be.</p>"}

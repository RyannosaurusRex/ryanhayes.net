Azure Functions is basically functions as a service. You can basically write a single function in JavaScript or C# and it manages the entire infrastructure around it. You don’t need to worry about scaling, networking, load balancing, even containers. In my time evaluating it, one of the things I found was that the best and easiest application for easing into using Azure Functions is as part of your continuous delivery infrastructure.  A lot of times it’s scary to try new cloud services, or at minimum get experience with these new technologies in a “real” setting. Azure functions are perfect for getting developer utilities into production without having to manage our own server.</p>\n<p>Here are the slides from my talk.</p>\n\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 72.91666666666666%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"//slides.com/ryanhayes/azure-functions/embed\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          "}

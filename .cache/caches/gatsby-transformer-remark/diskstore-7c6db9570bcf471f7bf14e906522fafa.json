Or, if think checking things off lists are for your losers, you can simply set a reminder in your favorite calendar application. Schedule it in to make sure you have time!</p>\n<p><strong>3.  (Induced) Peer Pressure</strong></p>\n<p>Now, obviously, you can’t disclose certain information about projects, and especially not if you’re working for the government, but <a>peer pressure</a> can be be a powerful tool.  <a>One idea</a> on <a>Stack Overflow</a> shows that a good way to do this is to create a Facebook Page for your project.  Tell everyone how your project will change their life!  Then, they’ll be hounding you so much to see a release of it that you’ll be motivated by sheer nagging to get it done. The <a>daily stand-up meeting</a> in Agile is designed to be a form of peer pressure that can be leveraged at the workplace.  Many people think the daily “status” meeting is held to find out what everyone is working on.  In fact, it’s designed to help know what everyone is NOT working on.  This motivates you to not look like a slacker (the <em>bad</em> lazy) when someone asks you, <em>“Hey, how’s project X you were working on going?  Isn’t that thing done yet?”</em>  __  __ So, remember, kids:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you can do it, and do what’s most productive!</li>\n<li>Automate reminders so you don’t forget about the old project AGAIN.</li>\n<li>Leverage others to put pressure on you to get it out the door!</li>\n</ol>"}

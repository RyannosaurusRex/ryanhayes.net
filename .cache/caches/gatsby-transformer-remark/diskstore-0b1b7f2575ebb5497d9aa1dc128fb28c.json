We’ve also made a number of other targeted changes, including some additional Win7-specific MFC APIs to support use of Direct2D, DirectWrite, and Windows Animation Technologies. There were also a number of areas where you told us we could do better, so we went in and filled some holes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unit Testing on .NET 3.5</strong> – today all unit tests are run under .NET 4. While acceptable for most users because of the compatibility work we did in .NET 4, this caused problems for some of you with .NET 3.5-specific dependencies.</li>\n<li><strong>IntelliTrace F5 for 64 bit and SharePoint projects</strong> – you’ve told us that IntelliTrace is great, but you want to use it on all the projects you’re working on.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance Wizard for Silverlight</strong> – Similarly, our performance profiling tools are very useful, but you want to use them for your Silverlight development as well. Silverlight projects are included in the Wizard just like your client projects today.</li>\n<li><strong>VB Compiler runtime switch</strong> – This switch will enable Visual Basic developers to target their apps and libraries at platforms where the full Visual Basic Runtime hasn’t traditionally been available.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=207267\" title=\"Download Service Pack 1 Beta (MSDN Subscribers only)\"><strong>Download Service Pack 1 Beta (MSDN Subscribers only)</strong></a><br>\n<a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=207130\"><strong>Download available for everyone 12/9/2010 is</strong> <strong>here</strong>.</a></p>"}

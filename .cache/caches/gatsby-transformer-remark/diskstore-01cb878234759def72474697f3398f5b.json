Azure Functions is basically functions as a service. You can basically write a single function in JavaScript or C# and it manages the entire infrastructure around it. You don’t need to worry about scaling, networking, load balancing, even containers. In my time evaluating it, one of the things I found was that the best and easiest application for easing into using Azure Functions is as part of your continuous delivery infrastructure.  A lot of times it’s scary to try new cloud services, or at minimum get experience with these new technologies in a “real” setting. Azure functions are perfect for getting developer utilities into production without having to manage our own server.","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":1,"column":794,"offset":793}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":1,"column":794,"offset":793}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Here are the slides from my talk.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":795},"end":{"line":3,"column":34,"offset":828}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":795},"end":{"line":3,"column":34,"offset":828}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 72.91666666666666%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"//slides.com/ryanhayes/azure-functions/embed\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          ","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1,"offset":830},"end":{"line":5,"column":182,"offset":1011}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":182,"offset":1011}}}}

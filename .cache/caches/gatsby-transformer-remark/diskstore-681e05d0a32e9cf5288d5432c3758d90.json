– <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/\">Windows Azure Websites</a></h2>\n<p>Once you’ve built your app, you need a place to host it!  Currently, Azure has a rocking deal of up to 10 shared IIS websites hosted on Azure for free.  You only pay for when you want to scale up.  If you need something more dedicated, remember that the BizSpark MSDN Subscription comes with free Azure time to host your app if you need something a little more hardcore (service bus, CDN, blob storage, SQL Azure Database, etc).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All-in-all Microsoft has taken huge strides to lower the barrier of entry for startups.  That, combined with free hosting, marketing, market research tools, and the CRAZY productivity of Visual Studio 2012, C#, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework Code First and some <a href=\"https://ryanhayes.net/blog/shoelacemvc-open-source-asp-net-mvc-3-starter-project-for-build/\">great starter projects</a>, you’ve got a great chance at breaking loose from your day job and building the next great thing to help solve the world’s problems.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a great resource that you love to use to get tons of value for little/no money up-front?  Share it in the comments below!</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"}

Here’s a simple way to get and parse the RSS feed, modified from the ListActivity in IBM’s code and simplified for easier use. Here’s a simple way to get and parse an RSS feed once it is modified (read the whole article if you’re cutting corners):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>/*In a ListActivity class, this is in a loadFeed(ParserType type) method. Of course, this isn’t really necessary to read a feed. Only down to the “List<Message> messages = parser.parse();” line is necessary. You can then iterate through each message and call standard getters for each of the items to get the Title, Description, etc.*/</p>\n<p>//Get a new FeedParser from the factory.<br>\n//Pass in the type of library you want to<br>\n//use as well as the URL of the feed<br>\n//you want to grab.<br>\nFeedParser parser = FeedParserFactory.getParser(type, getString(R.string.News_RSS_Feed));</p>\n<p>//Parse the feed into the Messages so you can<br>\n//use the feed data more easily in your app.<br>\nList<Message>= parser.parse();<br>\nString xml = writeXml();</p>\n<p>//Iterate through each RSS entry and grab the titles to use as the content in the ListView<br>\nList<titles>= new ArrayList<string>(messages.size());<br>\nfor (Message msg : messages){<br>\ntitles.add(msg.getTitle());<br>\n}</p>\n<p>//Add the ListView via an ArrayAdapter<br>\nArrayAdapter<string> adapter =<br>\nnew ArrayAdapter<string>(this, R.layout.row,titles);</p>\n<p>this.setListAdapter(adapter); </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>DONE! Simple as that. RSS is a great way to integrate content into you mobile application and have a similar (and often better) experience to the web version. The original IBM post is located below, where you can also download the full source.  This code was writted for Android SDK release 3, but it worked perfectly with the 7th release (Android 2.1). Remember that when you copy over the code into your project, ensure your manifest file properly registers all the appropriate activities.

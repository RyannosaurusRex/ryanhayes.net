classes and utilities will be hidden deep in source control with no documentation.  Writing a quick .nuspec file and adding a NuPack step in the TeamCity build process (all ready out of the box) lets you give new developers a single NuGet feed URL and have instant access to production-ready components that have been built by TeamCity.  In addition, everything is auditable since the builds are automated from check-in to release, so every NuGet package has “living documentation” as to how to build it, where it is in source control, and is gated so components in the feed are guaranteed to be unit tested and ready to go.  The power of NuGet also lets you pack README.txt or example config files, and even change the web.config if you need to so there’s no question how to get rolling with a

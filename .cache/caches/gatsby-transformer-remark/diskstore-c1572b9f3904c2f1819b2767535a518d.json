My initial requirements and posts will be:</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A Tab menu to divide the following sections</li>\n<li>\n<p>News Tab </p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is a list of announcements</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Radio Tab</li>\n<li>Sermon list</li>\n<li>\n<p>Videos </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open media with music player intent</li>\n<li>Open media with embedded player</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Visit!

Once you’ve done that, Visual Studio or the command line compiler will check all the code for errors like it would a typed language, and spit out the plain Javascript for it.  So, at it’s core, it’s not so much a new language as it is sugar for letting tools have something more concrete to check against.  You can even create a definition file for libraries like jQuery to get checking from them as well.  In future versions there’ll be a generator that you can point to an existing Javascript file and generate a definition file.  Pretty sweet!</p>\n<p>I tried setting it up in Visual Studio, but had a hard time getting it to compile on build.  I was still having to run the command line compiler (this was on an existing project, so that may have had something to do with it).</p>\n<h2>Here are the steps to get it working to compile your Typescript files on build in Visual Studio 2012:</h2>\n<!--more-->\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34790\">Download and Install the Typescript plugin for Visual Studio</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6\">Download and Install the Web Essentials 2012 plugin for Visual Studio</a></li>\n<li>In Visual Studio, go to <strong>TOOLS > Options</strong></li>\n<li>Select <strong>Web Essentials</strong></li>\n<li>Change the Option for <strong>Compile all TypeScript files on build</strong> to <strong>True</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n  That's all you need to get you going!  Plus, Web Essentials has a lot of other handy features included as well, like minifying your JavaScript to improve performance.  Pretty nice!\n</div>\n<div>\n</div>\n<div>\n  Have you used TypeScript yet?  What do you think about it?  If you don't like it, what are some good alternatives for building large-scale, JavaScript-intensive applications and keeping them human readable and more easily debuggable?\n</div>\n<div>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <a href=\"https://ryanhayes.wpengine.comimg/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/TypeScript-Settings_odh81v.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1001347399\" title=\"TypeScript Settings\" alt=\"TypeScript Settings\" src=\"https://ryanhayes.wpengine.comimg/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/TypeScript-Settings_odh81v.png\" width=\"761\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://ryanhayes.netimg/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/TypeScript-Settings_odh81v.png 761w, https://ryanhayes.netimg/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/TypeScript-Settings_odh81v-300x175.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\"></a>\n</div>\n<div>\n</div>"}

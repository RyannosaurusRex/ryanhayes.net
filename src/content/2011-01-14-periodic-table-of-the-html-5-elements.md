Have you heard?  HTML 5 is out!  (er, is coming, depending on how you see things).  It's still a work in progress, but you can still use HTML 5 now with many of the new browsers.  What does that mean for us as developers?  New things to learn, of course!  New techniques, new designs, but mostly: new tags!  There are lots of new tags in HTML 5 that are specific to headers, footers, navigation, and more.  Luckily, web developer [Josh Duck](https://joshduck.com/) has made an awesome interactive [Table of the HTML 5 Elements](https://joshduck.com/periodic-table.html).<!--more-->The table below is just a sample of the awesomeness!  Head over to

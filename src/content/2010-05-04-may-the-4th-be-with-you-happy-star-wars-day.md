Every year, nerds from all over the world come out of the woodworks to tell their favorite pun to all the folks of Earth and [Tatooine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatooine) they meet.  That day, my friends, is May the 4th.  You see, “Fourth” sounds like “Force” if you say it with a slur and a mouth full of [Wookie Cookies](https://www.amazon.com/Wookiee-Cookies-Star-Wars-Cookbook/dp/0811821846).  As you know, I’m big into tech, and that passion and intrigue, for most people like me, came from seeing Star Wars at a young age.  We saw all that was possible by technology, from flying [starships](https://www.kiddierides.co.uk/product_detail.asp?catID=2&productID=38) to [chopping aliens’ arms off with lightsabers](https://kottkegae.appspot.com/images/obama-lightsaber-02.jpg) to having a real heart-to-heart conversation with a trash can that beeps.  So today, think back to your childhood and about what your passion is.  What show did you watch or event did you experience that made you want to go out and conquer the world as a developer, a teacher, a pharmacist, or an evil Sith lord that’s more machine now than a man?

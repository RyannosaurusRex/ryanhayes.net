I recently gave a talk on browser automation and using Selenium with WebDriver.  Not only that, I gave a demo of using Selenium, WebDriver, xUnit, and creating a fluent API to create a framework that makes tests easy to compose.  Check them out and let me know what you think!  Selenium is a fantastic way to get a ton of value from automated front-end tests.

I recently just migrated my blog from [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com "Tumblr.") to my own [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org "Wordpress") install.  So far, things have been great.  I love having everything in one place &#8211; from my blog to my CV.  The only problem with this, however, is that **if something should happen, I'd lose everything**!  That's not a good place to be.  Ever.  Even if it's your own personal website, just think about how many hours it would take to just get the site with your original design back up.  Not to mention all the content produced over the years.  What options are there for backing up WordPress?  The good folks at [ChurchIT](https://churchit.com "ChurchIT") gave me a great place to start (and other great backup tips not mentioned here).<!--more-->Basically, you use 

[WPTimeMachine](https://wptimemachine.com/), which is a plugin for WordPress that lets you backup to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTYzOTY2MDk?src=global0), [The Amazon S3 Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), or your own FTP site.  Pretty nifty, huh?  A backup solution for your WordPress site that will cost you nothing.  Now there's no excuse!

BONUS: Get an extra 250MB of storage space if you [use my Dropbox referral link](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTYzOTY2MDk?src=global0)!  (You can use Dropbox to store anything and access it anywhere, even your Android or iPhone.)

BONUS +1: ChurchIT also explains how you can use Dropbox as a CDN for your WordPress blog.  [Check it out!](https://churchit.com/use-dropbox-as-cdn-for-your-wordpress-blog/)

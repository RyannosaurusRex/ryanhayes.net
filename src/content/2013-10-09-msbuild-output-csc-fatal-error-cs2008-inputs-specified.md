Today I was setting up an automated build using TeamCity and came across an issue where the build of the solution kept failing. Â The only reason that was given was this:

> [MSBuild output] CSC : fatal error CS2008: No inputs specified

Turns out that **MSBuild actually fails the whole build when you&#8217;re running it from the command line like this if there&#8217;s not a file that it can build**. Â The project in question was actually just full of XML and configuration files that other projects referenced and got published with a NuGet package to our private feed. Â **To fix it, I just added a simple .cs file, so that MSBuild had something to do. Â ðŸ™‚**

Here&#8217;s the code:

[syntax type=&#8221;html|php|js|css&#8221;]

using System;  
using System.Collections.Generic;  
using System.Linq;  
using System.Text;

namespace Configuration  
{  
class MSBuildBugFix  
{  
// MSBuild has a bug where if no source files are found, the build fails when  
// running from the commandline (or in our case, TeamCity). This file is only here  
// to allow the build to complete.  
}  
}

[/syntax]

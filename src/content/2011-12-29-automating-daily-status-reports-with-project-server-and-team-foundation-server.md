In the past, I&#8217;ve had managers who have asked me for a daily status report of all of the items I&#8217;ve worked on during the day&#8230;every single one.  They essentially said if it&#8217;s not documented that it didn&#8217;t happen.  With all the tools we have available to us as developers, there should never actually be a case where what we code isn&#8217;t documented.  I&#8217;ve heard many people say that 10 minutes is about the amount of time you should have between source control commits, which means there should be a TON of paper trail to show for what you&#8217;re working on.  The problem is how do you show this to non-technical managers?  Do you give them access to source control to see commits?   What if even printing out the commit log is too technical for them?  At bare minimum, they&#8217;re likely using some sort of project management tool.  Luckily, today we can connect source control, bug/task trackers, and project management tools together to automate &#8220;daily status reports&#8221; away forever.  In this video I talk about [Microsoft&#8217;s Project Server and Team Foundation Server connector](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2011/03/08/vs-tfs-2010-sp1-and-tfs-project-server-integration-feature-pack-have-released.aspx) that lets you do just that.  Take a look.

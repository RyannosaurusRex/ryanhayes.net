If you've been a software developer for a few years, you're probably familiar with the concept of a hackathon. A hackathon is a set time frame, usually 24 hours, where teams come together and build something. At the end of the time limit they present their creations to an audience, including judges. Depending on the types of hackathons, the winners can take home fantastic prizes, like funding for their idea.

If you enter a hackathon, you probably want to win.

What if I told you there's a formula for winning hackathons?

Well, there is. Let me explain.

I've been a Startup Weekend coach, entered several hackathons, but have been on teams to win the last two we've held internally at the company I currently work for. We didn't build these amazing magical features that you might "technically" be amazed at. We didn't even stay up all night like some other teams. All we did was follow a formula that makes hackathons much easier to win.

I recently gave a talk at TriDev about Azure Functions, the serverless programming product from Microsoft. Azure Functions is basically functions as a service. You can basically write a single function in JavaScript or C# and it manages the entire infrastructure around it. You don&#8217;t need to worry about scaling, networking, load balancing, even containers. In my time evaluating it, one of the things I found was that the best and easiest application for easing into using Azure Functions is as part of your continuous delivery infrastructure.Â  A lot of times it&#8217;s scary to try new cloud services, or at minimum get experience with these new technologies in a &#8220;real&#8221; setting. Azure functions are perfect for getting developer utilities into production without having to manage our own server.

Here are the slides from my talk.

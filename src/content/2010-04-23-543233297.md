[<img width="500" alt="Smithsonian Air and Space Museum" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3309/3196696375_d78cc2d7e0.jpg" alt="" />](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ryanocerous/3196696375/ "Smithsonian Air and Space Museum by Ryannosaurus Rex, on Flickr")

The photo above was taken around in 2008 in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in downtown Washington, DC.  Sometime later that year, I got a Flickr mail that my photo was a finalist to be featured on Schmap, which it ended up being!  (Honestly, I don't really like Schmap because it feels too Mapquesty &#8211; just my opinion, though)

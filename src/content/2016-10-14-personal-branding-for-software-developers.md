I recently gave a talk on branding for software developers at TriJS.  While I didn&#8217;t get a chance to record it, I did upload the slides for your viewing please.  The slides are readable without listening to the talk and have a few protips and specific actionable things that you can do to boost your personal brand as a developer.  It&#8217;s one of those things where you don&#8217;t really need it until you want to change jobs or you need to promote something, then you wish you did.  If you don&#8217;t know how to get started, take a look at the slides and let me know some of the things that you&#8217;ve done to increase your visibility as a software developer!

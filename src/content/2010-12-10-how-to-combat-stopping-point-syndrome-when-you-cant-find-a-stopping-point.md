Do you have _Stopping Point Syndrome?_ I didn&#8217;t know that I had it until I read a recent post on [Programmers.SE](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/25234/what-to-do-about-stopping-point-syndrome/25243#25243) about how someone just couldn&#8217;t find a stopping point and would work into the night or until he passed out.  In essence, it&#8217;s when you want to wait until you get to a good stopping point, but you just can&#8217;t seem to get there.  It&#8217;s a real problem, and one that many of us have faced before.  Here&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve helped curb this problem in my own development life and used this need of a stopping point to my advantage.<!--more-->

## **Check-in early.  Check-in often.**

The benefit of this is many-fold.  Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror wrote on [the benefits of early and often check-ins of your code](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/08/check-in-early-check-in-often.html).  You can go back to previous versions, see the progression of code, etc.  In general, you should check-in early and often to find integration issues early.  **The side benefit is that checking-in early and often gives you more frequent stopping points** so you can close the laptop lid and go home when the time comes.

## **Use GTD.**

The [Getting Things Done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) methodology is a way of working that uses prioritized task lists to&#8230;get things done!  Some people are more fanatical about it than others, but the essence of the idea can definitely help deal with SPS.   Working using a task list forces you to break down the things you&#8217;re working on into smaller chunks, which gives you more frequent stopping points.  There are a lot of great tools out there to help with tasks like [Remember The Milk](http://rememberthemilk.com) and Outlook, but hopefully you should have a bug/task tracking system set up for your development team that will do exactly this.  If you don&#8217;t have one &#8211; get one!  If you do, try to make sure everyone is on-board with entering tasks and making them small and manageable, linking smaller ones together to create big tasks.

## **Use and stick to your calendar.**

Pen (don&#8217;t pencil) into your schedule events at home and with friends, time for sleep/food or whatever and **stick to it**.  Set up reminders ahead of time so you can be aware that you need to get to a stopping point soon.

## Conclusion

So, there you have it, some quick tips on how to get to a stopping point faster at the end of the day.  You&#8217;re much more productive when you&#8217;ve had sleep and are happy than when you feel like you&#8217;re never getting anything accomplished and only see progress after huge/long stretches of coding.  **At the end of the day, it takes willpower and just saying no to continuing past a good stopping point.**

Do you have techniques or motivations that help you get to a stopping point when you need to?
